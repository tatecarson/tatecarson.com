Using technology, both artists interact and communicate with nature, creating work that comments on our relationship to the environment. I examine the theories and aesthetics of systems thinking to give background into the approaches of Saraceno  and  Dunn,  who  were  influenced  by  thinkers  Fritjof Capra, Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela, Jack Burnham, and Iannis Xenakis. I also use Jennie Gottschalk’s experimental music history to situate Dunn’s work with other experimental music of the time and relate Gottschalk’s ideas to Saraceno’s work.  Then, I consider how Saraceno’s <i>14 Billions</i> and Dunn’s <i>The Sound of Light in Trees</i> represent systems thinking.  Lastly, I discuss the aesthetics of inter-action with nature, including interspecies communication,that these works bring up</p><a href="http://tatecarson.com/assets/papers/ICMC_2019_Environmental_Interaction_in_the_Work_of_Tom_s_Saraceno_and_David_Dunn.pdf">Paper</a></div></div><div class="col-2"><div class="box"> <h3>Philisophical Underpinnings of Environmental Music  </h3><p class="subtext">2018  </p><p>The effectiveness of environmental music is explored through the lens of philosophers Gregory Bateson, through his theory of ecology of mind, and Timothy Morton, through his theory of hyperobjects. Bateson’s and Morton’s philosophies are concerned with how art can be used to communicate our interconnectedness to nature. Their philosophical underpinnings are applied as a framework for evaluating artists’ success in communicating this interconnectedness through environmental music. Works by composers Barry Truax, Hildegard Westerkamp, David Dunn, and Leah Barclay are discussed within these frameworks.</p><a href="http://tatecarson.com/assets/papers/carson_PhilisophicalUnderpinningsofEnvironmentalMusic.pdf">Paper</a></div></div></div></section>
